# üöÄ Vercel Deployment Checklist

Use this checklist to ensure your GrowCalculator is ready for Vercel deployment.

## ‚úÖ **Pre-Deployment Checklist**

### **Files Created/Modified**
- [ ] `vercel.json` - Vercel configuration file
- [ ] `api/index.py` - Serverless function entry point
- [ ] `services/vercel_shared_results_service.py` - Vercel-compatible service
- [ ] `requirements.txt` - Updated with Vercel dependencies
- [ ] `runtime.txt` - Python version specification
- [ ] `.vercelignore` - Exclude unnecessary files
- [ ] `VERCEL_DEPLOYMENT.md` - Deployment guide
- [ ] `test_vercel_local.py` - Local testing script
- [ ] `package.json` - Project metadata (optional)

### **Code Changes Made**
- [ ] Updated calculator routes to use Vercel service
- [ ] Added CORS middleware for Vercel
- [ ] Created custom static file handler
- [ ] Replaced SQLite with in-memory storage
- [ ] Added proper error handling for serverless environment

### **Testing Completed**
- [ ] Run `python test_vercel_local.py` - All tests pass
- [ ] Verify static files load correctly
- [ ] Test calculator functionality
- [ ] Test mutation system
- [ ] Test shared results (in-memory)

## üîß **Deployment Steps**

### **1. Git Preparation**
- [ ] Commit all changes to Git
- [ ] Push to your repository
- [ ] Ensure repository is public or Vercel has access

### **2. Vercel Dashboard Setup**
- [ ] Go to [vercel.com/dashboard](https://vercel.com/dashboard)
- [ ] Click "New Project"
- [ ] Import your Git repository
- [ ] Configure project settings:
  - Framework Preset: Other
  - Root Directory: Leave default
  - Build Command: Leave empty
  - Output Directory: Leave empty
  - Install Command: `pip install -r requirements.txt`

### **3. Deploy**
- [ ] Click "Deploy"
- [ ] Wait for build to complete
- [ ] Check for any build errors
- [ ] Verify deployment URL works

## üåê **Post-Deployment Verification**

### **Functionality Tests**
- [ ] Main calculator page loads
- [ ] Plant selection works
- [ ] Mutation selection works
- [ ] Calculations are accurate
- [ ] Static files (images, CSS, JS) load
- [ ] Mobile responsiveness works
- [ ] Share functionality works (in-memory)

### **Performance Checks**
- [ ] First load (cold start) completes within 30 seconds
- [ ] Subsequent requests are fast
- [ ] No memory errors in logs
- [ ] Static files serve quickly

### **Error Monitoring**
- [ ] Check Vercel function logs
- [ ] Monitor for 500 errors
- [ ] Verify error messages are user-friendly
- [ ] Check for any import or dependency issues

## ‚ö†Ô∏è **Known Limitations**

### **Vercel Serverless Constraints**
- [ ] Shared results reset on each function invocation (in-memory storage)
- [ ] Cold starts may cause initial delay
- [ ] Maximum 30-second function timeout
- [ ] 1024MB memory limit per function
- [ ] No persistent file system writes

### **Mitigation Strategies**
- [ ] In-memory storage for shared results (temporary)
- [ ] Optimized imports and startup
- [ ] Efficient calculation algorithms
- [ ] Proper error handling for timeouts

## üîç **Troubleshooting Common Issues**

### **Build Failures**
- [ ] Check Python version compatibility
- [ ] Verify all dependencies in requirements.txt
- [ ] Check for syntax errors in Python files
- [ ] Ensure proper import paths

### **Runtime Errors**
- [ ] Check Vercel function logs
- [ ] Verify static file paths
- [ ] Test locally with test script
- [ ] Check for missing environment variables

### **Performance Issues**
- [ ] Optimize calculation algorithms
- [ ] Reduce memory usage
- [ ] Minimize cold start time
- [ ] Use efficient data structures

## üìä **Monitoring & Maintenance**

### **Ongoing Tasks**
- [ ] Monitor Vercel analytics
- [ ] Check function performance metrics
- [ ] Review error logs regularly
- [ ] Update dependencies as needed
- [ ] Monitor memory usage

### **Scaling Considerations**
- [ ] Function execution time trends
- [ ] Memory usage patterns
- [ ] Error rate monitoring
- [ ] User experience metrics

## üéØ **Success Criteria**

Your deployment is successful when:
- [ ] All tests pass locally
- [ ] App deploys without errors
- [ ] All functionality works as expected
- [ ] Performance meets requirements
- [ ] Users can access the calculator
- [ ] Calculations remain accurate
